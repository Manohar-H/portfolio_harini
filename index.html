        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>

        <p>Hello! I'm Harini Manohar, a curious learner, passionate creator, and a driven professional. My story is one of transformation—spanning industries, geographies, and roles. </p>
        
        <h3>A Journey Across Healthcare, Technology, and Innovation</h3>
        <p>From my early days as a healthcare provider to my current journey as a software developer, I have embraced challenges, celebrated growth, and worked relentlessly to make a meaningful impact in everything I do.
        </p>
        <p>
        Born and raised in the culturally vibrant city of Chennai, India, I grew up with an innate curiosity to explore and learn. My parents, Anand and Meera Manohar, laid the foundation of my values, teaching me perseverance, empathy, and the importance of adaptability. These principles have guided me through life, helping me transition seamlessly across diverse fields.
        </p>

        <h3>My Early Passion for Healthcare</h3>
        <p>My fascination with science and the human connection led me to pursue a Bachelor of Dental Surgery (BDS) at Dr. MGR Medical University, where I immersed myself in the intricacies of dentistry and patient care. Over five years, I learned the importance of precision, attention to detail, and, most importantly, empathy. Treating patients was not merely a job—it was a calling that instilled in me a deep sense of purpose and responsibility.</p>
        <p>As I gained experience in dentistry, I realized I wanted to make an impact beyond the clinic walls. I was intrigued by the broader challenges of healthcare systems—the logistics, policies, and innovations that ensure patient care is efficient and accessible. To pursue this interest, I transitioned into healthcare administration, which marked a pivotal shift in my career.</p>

        <h3>The Transition to Healthcare Leadership</h3>
        <p>In 2015, I earned an MBA in Healthcare Administration from Mewar University. This journey was a revelation, teaching me how to approach healthcare from a systems perspective. I learned to design processes, manage teams, and implement strategies that improve healthcare delivery.</p>
        <p>During this time, I held various roles that challenged me and enriched my expertise. As a Team Leader at Artemis Health Institute and a Senior Executive at Medifriend Healthcare, I managed multidisciplinary teams, streamlined operations, and ensured that patients received the highest standard of care. These roles demanded strong leadership, problem-solving, and adaptability—all of which I honed through experience.</p>
        <p>One of the most rewarding aspects of this phase was the opportunity to lead with empathy. Whether it was mentoring a team member or resolving a patient's concerns, I found immense satisfaction in contributing to the well-being of individuals and the success of organizations.</p>

        <h3>Embracing Change: A Leap Into Technology</h3>
        <p>While I thrived in healthcare, I could not ignore the growing role of technology in transforming industries. I was fascinated by its ability to solve problems at scale, create efficiencies, and open up new possibilities. This realization inspired me to embark on a new journey—a journey into the world of software development.</p>
        <p>In 2024, I took the leap and enrolled in a Diploma in Software Development at Keyin College. It was an entirely new domain for me, but I was excited by the challenge. Learning to code felt like unlocking a new language—a language of innovation, creativity, and problem-solving.</p>

        <h3>Key Achievements and Milestones</h3>
        <p>Over the years, I've celebrated numerous milestones that reflect my journey and growth:
        <ul>
            <li>Successfully transitioning between industries, demonstrating my adaptability and commitment to learning.</li>
            <li>Building diverse skills in healthcare administration, customer service, and software development.</li>
            <li>Creating innovative projects like the Tata Motors website and Meera's Kitchen, which combine technical skills with storytelling.</li>
            <li>Earning certifications in areas such as Six Sigma and Disaster Management, which highlight my dedication to excellence and leadership.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each achievement is a reminder of the power of hard work, determination, and the courage to step outside one’s comfort zone.</p>

        <h3>What Drives Me: A Vision for the Future</h3>
        <p>As I look ahead, I am excited about the opportunities to make a meaningful impact through technology. My goal is to become a full-stack developer, creating solutions that not only address technical challenges but also resonate with human needs. I want to work on projects that improve lives, foster connections, and contribute to a more inclusive and innovative world.</p>
        <p>Beyond my career, I am committed to personal growth. Whether it's honing my skills, exploring new passions, or deepening my connections with loved ones, I strive to embrace life with curiosity and gratitude.</p>
